# flappy-bird-neat

This repository implements a flappy bird game using NEAT - evolving arbitrary neural networks. Flappy Bird is a popular side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. This project uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve neural networks capable of playing the game autonomously.

## Get started

Please make sure you use 3.10 <= Python version <= 3.11. To install the packages run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To start flappy bird run:

```
python main.py
```
